## Objective

The objective of this project is to code a method of statistical data compression that reduces the
length of the coding of an alphabet, i.e. such that the average length of a coded text is minimal.
This method is the basis of the Huffman code.

## Git commands

### Commit a new change
* `$ git status`
* `$ git add filename.txt`
* `$ git commit -m "Description of the changes"`
* `$ git push`

### Work on a branch
* To create a new branch and switch to it at the same time, you can run `$ git checkout -b branch-name`
* To switch back to the main branch, run `$ git checkout main`
* To get changes from the main branch on your branch, run `$ git pull`
* To merge master with a branch, run `$ git merge branch-name`
